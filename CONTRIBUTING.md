# Contributing to Daily Tools

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Daily Tools! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place. We welcome any and all contributions.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/tools-daily/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/tools-daily/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`. A good branch name would be `feat/my-new-tool` or `fix/bug-in-timestamp-converter`.
2.  **Set up the project** by following the instructions in the README.md.
3.  **Make your changes.** Make sure to follow the existing code style.
4.  **Test your changes** to ensure that your contribution works as expected and does not break anything.
5.  **Update the documentation** if you have changed APIs, added new features, or fixed a bug that needs documenting.
6.  **Commit your changes** using a clear and descriptive commit message.
7.  **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the `tools-daily` repository.

Once your pull request is submitted, a project maintainer will review it. You may be asked to make changes before it can be merged.
